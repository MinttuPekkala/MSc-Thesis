# Comparison of Surface Albedo and Top of Atmosphere Albedo in the Arctic

This GitHub repository contains Python code used for data analysis executed as a part of 
Msc thesis project. 

## Description

Data analysis includes combination and reprojection of data, masking data, modelling results 
with SMAC and finally plotting the results. A dataset for creating masks is also provided.

### Installing

It is recommended that conda forge Python package manager for module installation. 

### Executing program

The files in this repository are named in accordance to the stages of analysis. 

Step 1: Combining starting data
Step 2: Creating Masks for data
Step 3: Masking data
Step 4: Modelling results with the Simple Model for Atmospheric Correction (SMAC)
Step 5: Plotting results of data analysis


## Help

It is adviced to use gc.collect() function provided in the gc module for automatic memory management.
